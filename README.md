### This here is the first game I ever made, terribly titled albeit

This game was made entirely with JavaScript/HTML which was a weird choice of language for my first game.
However it allowed me to understand how games process things per frame, and let me build something from the ground up.

### What is it?
You move this square around a small area collecting dots. The more dots you collect, the faster the enemy moves. You can also shoot the enemy. 
Thats it!

Very simple game, but I had to implement an A* algorithm so enemy would track you, so that was something fun. Apart from that, its a very basic game and not entirely fun to play.
On top of that it's riddled with bugs.

However, still an important homage to where my career began.
